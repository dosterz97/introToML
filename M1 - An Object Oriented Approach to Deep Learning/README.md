# An Object Oriented Approach to Deep Learning
The issues with a lot of materials for understanding deep learning / machine learning / artificial inteligence is that they either feature too much a 'black-box' or it is to involved in explaining the mathmatical side of things for the reader / student to really grasp whats going on in the examples. The goal of this module is to showcase how you can load data into a python program and spit out a real working, trained model.
